# Overview

This exercise is to implement the best possible solution to one of the exercises below in the time alloted. We're evaluating your ability to take a set of requirements and spike a holistic solution that demonstrates craftsmanship, thoughtfulness and attention to user experience. 

This is **NOT** a test of how well you know .NET, nor should you try to impress us with overly clever and obtuse solutions. If you want to impress us, build something that is beautiful, intuitive and easy to debug/test/extend :smiley: .

Ideally your solution would have some way to run locally and visualize the results in a browser so we can fully analyze the experience and not just the source code.
